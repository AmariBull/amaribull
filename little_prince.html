            As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took him in my arms and set out walking once more. <span class="underline"> I felt deeply moved, and stirred. 
            It seemed to me that I was carrying a very fragile treasure.</span>  <span class="highlight">It seemed to me, even, that there was nothing more fragile 
            on all Earth. </span> In the moonlight I looked at his pale forehead, his closed eyes, his locks of hair that trembled in the wind, and I said to myself: 
            <span class="color">"What I see here is nothing but a shell. What is most important is invisible....‚Äù </span>   As his lips opened slightly with the suspicion of a
            half-smile, I said to myself again:  <span class="color">"What moves me so deeply, about this little prince who is sleeping here, is his loyalty to a flower--
            the image of a rose that shines through his whole being like the flame of a lamp, even when he is asleep..."</span> And I felt him to be more
            fragile still. <span class="underline">I felt the need of protecting his, as if he himself were a flame that might be extinguished by a little puff of wind...</span>
